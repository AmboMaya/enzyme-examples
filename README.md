# Enzyme Examples

To use, clone this repo and then `yarn`.

To run the tests using a 'headless browser' environment (tape-run): `yarn test`.  To start the development server with a watcher that refreshes your browser, run `npm start`.

To run tests continuously, use `yarn dev`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.
